# LongarmLIDAR
Data and codes for long-arm 3D LIDAR

- Demos: Read and show LIDAR data. 

- Calibration: Process of calibration with two degrees of freedom. Run 'main_calibratetheta2' first and then 'main_calibrateR'.

- CalibrationPrecise:Process of calibration with four degrees of freedom. Run 'main_calibrateAll_201357.m' first and then 'main_calibrate_byhand201357.m'.

- Anti_occlusion_test: Data of anti-occlusion scenarios and display functions.

- Adaptive_scanning: Demonstration for adaptive resolution scanning.
